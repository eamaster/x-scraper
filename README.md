# X Scraper

A powerful and easy-to-use web application for searching and exploring Twitter data. This tool allows you to search for tweets by keyword or hashtag, and to find tweets from specific users, with or without a keyword filter.

## Features

- **Keyword Tweet Search:** Find tweets containing any keyword or #hashtag.
- **User Profile Search:** Fetch recent tweets from any public Twitter user.
- **User Keyword Search:** Combine the power of both searches! Look for a specific keyword or phrase within a particular user's tweets.
- **Advanced Sorting:** Sort search results by date, likes, or retweets to easily find the most relevant content.
- **Clean & Modern UI:** A professional, responsive, and intuitive interface makes searching for tweets a seamless experience.

## How to Use

1.  **Clone the repository.**
2.  Open `index.html` in your browser, or run a local web server (e.g., `python -m http.server`) in the project directory.
3.  Enter your search query and get instant results.
3. Click the "Search" button.
4. The user's profile information and recent tweets will be displayed.

## API

This project uses the [Twttr API on RapidAPI](https://rapidapi.com/sowmen_barua/api/twttr). You will need a RapidAPI key to use it. The key is already included in `script.js` for convenience, but for a production application, it should be handled more securely.
