# X Scraper

This is a simple web dashboard to search for public Twitter profiles and view their details, recent tweets, and engagement metrics.

## How to Use

1. Open `index.html` in your web browser.
2. Enter a Twitter username in the search box.
3. Click the "Search" button.
4. The user's profile information and recent tweets will be displayed.

## API

This project uses the [Twttr API on RapidAPI](https://rapidapi.com/sowmen_barua/api/twttr). You will need a RapidAPI key to use it. The key is already included in `script.js` for convenience, but for a production application, it should be handled more securely.
